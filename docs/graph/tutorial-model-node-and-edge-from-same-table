# Tutorial: Add multiple node and edge types from one mapping table

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

This tutorial explains the less straightforward situation where you need to use one mapping table to create multiple node type(s) and edge type(s).

## Adventure Works Employee table

In the Adventure Works data model, you can use the **Employees** table to create an **employee** node type, a **country** node type, and an **employee_lives_in_country** edge type.

The **Employees** table has the following columns:

| Column name       |
| ----------------- |
| employeeIDK       | 
| managerID         |
| employeeFullName  |
| jobTitle          |
| organizationLevel |
| maritalStatus     |
| gender            |
| territory         |
| country           |
| group             |
| produces          |
