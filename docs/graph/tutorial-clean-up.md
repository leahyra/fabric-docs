# Tutorial: Clean up tutorial resources

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

In this tutorial step, you learn how to clean up the resources you created during the tutorial. Cleaning up resources helps you avoid unnecessary charges and keeps your workspace organized.

## Delete the graph model

To delete the graph model, you created:

1. Go to your [Microsoft Fabric workspace](https://fabric.microsoft.com/).
1. Find the graph model you created (for example, "AdventureWorksGraph").
1. Select the **More options** (...) menu next to the graph model.
1. Select **Delete**.
1. Confirm the deletion.

## Delete the workspace (optional)

If you created a new workspace specifically for this tutorial and you no longer need it, you can delete the entire workspace:

1. Navigate to **Workspaces** from the left navigation pane.
1. Select the workspace you want to delete.
1. Select **Workspace settings** (gear icon).
1. Select **Remove this workspace** under **Delete workspace**.
1. Confirm the deletion.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a workspace permanently removes all items in the workspace, including lakehouses, graphs, reports, and other artifacts. You can't undo this action.
