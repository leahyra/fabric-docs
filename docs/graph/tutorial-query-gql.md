# Tutorial: Query the graph by using GQL

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](./includes/feature-preview-note.md)]

In this tutorial step, you learn how to query your graph by using GQL (Graph Query Language) in the code editor. GQL provides powerful querying capabilities for complex graph patterns and analysis.

## Switch to code editor mode

Follow these steps to switch to the code editor and start querying your graph by using GQL:

1. Go to your graph's home page.
1. Select **Code editor** from the top menu.

## Run a basic query

1. Enter a GQL query into the input field. For example, count all orders:

    ```gql
    MATCH (n:`Order`) RETURN count(n) AS num_orders
    ```

1. Select **Run query** to execute the query.

This query finds all nodes with the `Order` label, counts them, and returns the total as `num_orders`. It's a simple way to confirm your graph has data. The following image shows the result of the query:

## Recreate the query builder query in GQL

In the [previous tutorial step](tutorial-query-builder.md), you used the query builder to find what products a specific customer purchased. Here's the same query written in GQL:

```gql
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:purchases]->(o:`Order`)-[:`contains`]->(p:`Product`)
FILTER c.fullName = 'Carla Adams'
RETURN c.fullName, o, p.productName
```

This query:

1. **Matches** the pattern Customer → purchases → Order → contains → Product
1. **Filters** for the customer named "Carla Adams"
1. **Returns** the customer's full name, order details, and product names

The following image shows the result of the query (only a portion of the returned data is shown).

:::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial/code-editor-query-results-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the result of running a GQL query to find products purchased by Carla Adams." lightbox="./media/tutorial/code-editor-query-results-2.png":::

## Run a complex query

You can run more complex queries that combine matching graph patterns, filtering, aggregation, sorting, and limiting:

```gql
MATCH (v:Vendor)-[:produces]->(p:`Product`)->(sc:`ProductSubcategory`)->(c:`ProductCategory`), 
      (o:`Order`)-[:`contains`]->(p)
FILTER c.subCategoryName = 'Touring Bikes'
LET vendorName = v.vendorName, subCategoryName = sc.subCategoryName
RETURN vendorName, subCategoryName, count(DISTINCT p) AS num_products, count(o) AS num_orders
GROUP BY vendorName, subCategoryName
ORDER BY num_orders DESC
LIMIT 5
```

This query:

1. **Matches** a pattern that connects vendors to products through the supply chain, and orders to products.
1. **Filters** for products in the 'Touring Bikes' category.
1. **Defines** variables for vendor and subcategory names.
1. **Returns** the vendor name, subcategory name, distinct product count, and order count.
1. **Groups** results by vendor and subcategory.
1. **Orders** results by order count in descending order.
1. **Limits** results to the top 5.

In summary, it shows the top five vendors supplying products in the 'Touring Bikes' category, along with how many products they supply and how many orders those products have.

## GQL query patterns

Here are some common GQL query patterns you can use:

### Find all nodes of a type

```gql
MATCH (c:Customer) RETURN c
```

### Find nodes with specific properties

```gql
MATCH (p:Product) FILTER p.productName = 'Mountain Bike' RETURN p
```

### Traverse relationships

```gql
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:purchases]->(o:Order)-[:contains]->(p:Product)
RETURN c, o, p
```

### Aggregate data

```gql
MATCH (e:Employee)-[:sells]->(o:Order)
RETURN e.employeeName, count(o) AS total_orders
GROUP BY e.employeeName
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
```
