# Supply chain reference architecture 

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive supply chain solutions that handle real-time data from ERP systems, logistics feeds, and vendor networks. You can process purchase orders, delivery schedules, and shipment tracking while integrating inventory management and vendor contracts to enable intelligent supply chain optimization with predictive analytics and automated decision-making.

You can manage complex supply chain operations where systems continuously stream data on inventory levels, shipment status, and vendor performance.

## Architecture overview

The supply chain reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from supply chain systems and integrates logistics data for intelligent supply chain management. You can implement the architecture with five main operational phases, divided into ten steps:

:::image type="content" source="media/supply-chain-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram of the supply chain architecture and data flow.":::

1. **[Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md)** ingests data from ERP systems, capturing purchase orders, delivery schedules, and vendor contracts.

1. Through MQTT-Eventstream integration, real-time streaming and batch logistics feeds track shipments, carrier updates, and route disruptions.

1. **[Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md)** orchestrates on-hand stock, reserved inventory, and reorder points, then sends this information to OneLake for cross-domain access.

1. Eventstream conducts real-time ETL on incoming data and then routes it to Eventhouse for deeper analysis.

1. KQL queries are written within **[Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md)** to correlate historical data from OneLake with time-series data on inventory and shipment data. 

1. Identifying seasonal demand shifts, **[Microsoft Graph](../../../graph/)** analyzes relationships between suppliers, shipments, and inventory to identify critical path dependencies and optimize supply chain decisions.

1. **[Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md)** predictive ML models forecast delivery delays using historical and real-time logistics data, while also scoring vendor performance based on reliability and responsiveness to help prioritize high-performing suppliers.

1. **[Real-Time Dashboards](../dashboard-real-time-create.md)** provide the realtime updates on shipments and alerts for delays to maintain service level agreements.

1. **[Power BI](../create-powerbi-report)** dashboards provide interactive views of KPIs, delivery status, risk scores, and installation readiness, supporting managers, field operations, and logistics.

1. **[Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction)** is triggered to escalate vendor manufacturing and shipment delays ensuring timely intervention.

## Supply chain data flow and processing

This section explains the end-to-end data flow in the supply chain architecture, from data ingestion to actionable insights, enabling real-time decision-making and optimization.

### Ingest and process

[Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md) ingests data from ERP systems, capturing purchase orders, delivery schedules, and vendor contracts. This continuous data integration provides real-time visibility into procurement activities, contract management, and vendor relationships for immediate supply chain decision-making.

Through MQTT-Eventstream integration, real-time streaming and batch logistics feeds track shipments, carrier updates, and route disruptions, enabling comprehensive logistics monitoring including:

- Shipment tracking and location updates
- Carrier performance and delivery status
- Route optimization and disruption alerts
- Transportation cost and timing analysis
- Real-time logistics event correlation

[Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md) orchestrates on-hand stock, reserved inventory, and reorder points, then sends this information to [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) for cross-domain access, including:

- Current inventory levels and availability
- Reserved stock and allocation management
- Reorder point monitoring and procurement triggers
- Warehouse capacity and distribution planning
- Cross-location inventory optimization

**Real-world scenario example**: A global manufacturing company processes real-time ERP data capturing thousands of purchase orders daily while MQTT-Eventstream integration tracks shipments from hundreds of suppliers across multiple continents. Data Factory orchestrates inventory data from dozens of warehouses, providing comprehensive visibility into stock levels, delivery schedules, and vendor performance for proactive supply chain management.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

[Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md) performs real-time ETL on incoming data and then routes it to [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md) for deeper analysis. This real-time processing enables immediate data transformation and enrichment, including:

- Data validation and quality assurance
- Real-time aggregation and calculation
- Event correlation and pattern detection
- Automated data routing and distribution
- Cross-system data synchronization

You write KQL queries within [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md) to correlate historical data from [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) with time-series data on inventory and shipment data, identifying seasonal demand shifts. This correlation enables:

- **Historical trend analysis** - Correlation of past performance with current supply chain events
- **Seasonal pattern recognition** - Identification of demand fluctuations and planning optimization
- **Inventory optimization** - Real-time correlation of stock levels with demand forecasts
- **Supply chain intelligence** - Deep analysis of vendor performance and logistics efficiency

### Model and contextualize

[Microsoft Graph](../../../graph/) analyzes relationships between suppliers, shipments, and inventory to identify critical path dependencies and optimize supply chain decisions. This relationship analysis provides:

- **Supplier network mapping** - Comprehensive view of vendor relationships and dependencies
- **Critical path identification** - Analysis of supply chain bottlenecks and risk points
- **Dependency optimization** - Strategic insights for supplier diversification and risk mitigation
- **Supply chain resilience** - Network analysis for disruption impact assessment and contingency planning

### Train

Predictive ML models forecast delivery delays by using historical and real-time logistics data. They also score vendor performance based on reliability and responsiveness to help prioritize high-performing suppliers. These models use [Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md) capabilities, including:

- **Delivery delay prediction models** - Forecast potential shipment delays based on logistics data, weather patterns, and carrier performance.
- **Vendor performance scoring** - Evaluate supplier reliability, quality, and responsiveness for strategic sourcing decisions.
- **Demand forecasting** - Predict future inventory requirements based on seasonal trends and market analysis.
- **Risk assessment modeling** - Identify supply chain vulnerabilities and optimize mitigation strategies.
- **Cost optimization analytics** - Predict total cost of ownership and optimize procurement decisions.

### Visualize and activate
