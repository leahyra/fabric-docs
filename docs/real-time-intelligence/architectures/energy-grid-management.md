# Energy grid management reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how to use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive energy grid management solutions that handle real-time data from energy generation facilities and grid consumption networks. You can process real-time manufacturing data from wind turbines and power plants, grid consumption events, and smart meter telemetry to enable intelligent energy grid operations with predictive analytics and real-time decision making. 

You can manage large-scale energy grids where thousands of energy generation sources and smart meters stream real-time data on production metrics, consumption patterns, and grid operational state. The architecture integrates CRM contextualization data via MQTT streaming and maintains comprehensive metadata and asset information on various types of energy infrastructure to create a unified energy grid platform. 

## Architecture overview 

The energy grid management reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from energy generation facilities and consumption networks for intelligent grid management. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform and enrich, Train, and Visualize and activate.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

The solution ingests real-time IoT data from energy manufacturing facilities, including wind turbines and power plants, through [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) and processes the data with subsecond latency. It streams energy grid data in real time, providing detailed insights into grid load distribution, demand patterns, and operational performance across the energy network.
This continuous data integration captures comprehensive energy generation metrics, including:

- Production capacity and generation metrics
- Facility specifications and operational baselines
- Renewable energy contribution and weather correlations
- Maintenance schedules and operational status

The solution pushes customer contextualization data via MQTT and processes it through [Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md), enabling enhanced analytics with:

- Smart meter IDs and customer address information
- Consumption profiles and billing data
- Customer segmentation and usage patterns

The solution synchronizes inventory and asset information from ERP systems into [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) using [Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md), enabling comprehensive energy infrastructure contextualization, including:

A major utility operator that manages 100,000 smart meters and 300 energy generation facilities processes over 10 million energy events per day. These events include power generation readings from wind turbines and power plants, real-time grid consumption data, smart meter telemetry, and customer billing information. The MQTT-Eventstream integration processes this data while maintaining subsecond latency for critical grid balancing decisions and demand response operations. 

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

Continuous transformations take place within Eventhouse, where real-time energy generation data from wind turbines and power plants is enriched with asset metadata from the ERP system. This process ensures fully curated and ready-for-consumption data, enabling immediate insights and operational efficiency. The enrichment process includes the following capabilities:

This forecasting helps optimize the integration of renewable energy into the grid, maximizing its utilization while maintaining stability.

- **Customer behavior analytics** - Analyze customer consumption patterns by using smart meter data to identify trends and anomalies. This information supports improved demand planning, personalized energy solutions, and targeted energy-saving initiatives for better customer engagement and grid efficiency.

### Visualize and activate

[Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction.md) in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence generates real-time notifications on energy spikes and forecasting of potential energy deficiencies. With this real-time awareness and automated responses, the system reduces manual intervention and enhances grid reliability. Key alerting capabilities include:
