# Call Data Records (CDR)/Event Detail Records (EDR) analytics reference architecture 
    
Telecommunications providers face increasing pressure to deliver exceptional network performance while managing massive volumes of Call Detail Records (CDR) and Event Detail Records (EDR). These records contain critical information about every call, data session, and network event across the mobile infrastructure. Traditional batch processing approaches can't keep pace with the real-time insights needed for modern network operations.

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive CDR/EDR analytics solutions that handle real-time streaming of over 1TB/hour of decoded EDR/CDR data from mobile core networks. You can process continuous customer data streams and integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contextualization metadata to enable intelligent network monitoring, customer analytics, and predictive network operations. 

The architecture addresses the challenges of managing complex mobile network environments where core network systems continuously generate massive CDR/EDR data volumes while customer devices and network infrastructure provide contextual information. By implementing this solution, you can transform raw telecommunications data into actionable insights that drive network optimization and improve customer experience.

## Architecture overview 

The CDR/EDR analytics reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes high-volume mobile network data streams with ERP contextualization for intelligent network operations. This architecture eliminates data silos by bringing together CDR/EDR streams, customer information, and infrastructure metadata into a single analytics environment.

You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases that work together to deliver end-to-end network intelligence: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform, and enrich, Traing and score, and Visualize and activate.

The following steps describe the data flow through this architecture:

1. Real-time streaming of over 1TB/hour of decoded EDR/CDR data flows via MQTT-Eventstream from the mobile core network.

1. Customer data such as device, address, and mobile plan is pushed via MQTT and collected by Eventstream.

1. Contextualization metadata including inventory and cell network components from ERP sources is synced to OneLake using Data Factory with CDC to support data contextualization.

1. EDR/CDR data is enriched in-motion with the dimensional metadata.

1. Enriched data is aggregated for daily and weekly views on the fly for long-term retention.

1. ML models are built and trained, then used for real-time scoring.

1. In-depth, high-granularity network analytics visuals are created using the built-in Real-Time dashboard.

1. DirectQuery from Power BI to Eventhouse provides rich BI reports on the real-time data.

1. Notifications are created in real time to reduce response time and time to mitigate issues.
