# Law enforcement reference architecture - Real-time location tracking

When every second counts in an emergency, law enforcement agencies need immediate access to accurate device location data. This reference architecture demonstrates how to use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build a comprehensive analytics solution that processes over 1 TB/hour of decoded Event Data Records (EDR) and Call Data Records (CDR) from mobile core networks.

This architecture addresses the challenges of managing complex telecommunications environments where mobile core network mediation systems, cell towers, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems continuously generate massive data volumes that must be processed instantly for law enforcement requests.

## Architecture overview 

The following diagram shows how Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence creates a unified platform that processes high-volume CDR/EDR data streams and integrates customer information for critical emergency response services.

The architecture implements following steps in four main operational phases that are described in detail later in this document:

1. **Ingest telecommunications data** - Stream over 1 TB/hour of decoded EDR/CDR data via Eventstream with boundless scale from the mobile core network mediation system.

1. **Capture location data** - Stream cell tower events and geo-locations in real time via Eventstream for device positioning.

1. **Synchronize customer data** - Sync customer data from the CRM system into OneLake using Data Factory.

1. **Correlate and analyze** - Correlate real-time CDR/EDR data, cell tower locations, mobile devices, and customer facet tables in a secure and compliant way to provide the last known location of the device immediately.

1. **Audit and track** - Record all operations within Eventhouse for compliance and security monitoring.

1. **Deliver location services** - Respond to time-critical law enforcement requests for last known device locations through real-time dashboards.

1. **Provide customer records** - Collect and deliver full customer call and usage records through the customer support app.

## Operational phases

This section describes each operational phase in detail, explaining how data flows through the system from ingestion to visualization and how each component contributes to the overall solution.

### Ingest & process 

The ingestion phase captures high-volume telecommunications data from multiple sources and prepares it for real-time analysis. This phase handles the continuous flow of network events, location data, and customer information that forms the foundation of the location tracking system.

The system streams over 1 TB/hour of decoded EDR/CDR data via [Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md) with boundless scale from the mobile core network mediation system. This high-volume data integration captures comprehensive telecommunications information:

- **Call Detail Records (CDR)** include complete call routing, duration, and billing information for every call processed by the network.

- **Event Detail Records (EDR)** provide detailed network events and service usage data that help track device activity.

- **Mobile network signaling** captures device handovers, registrations, and network interactions as devices move between cells.

- **Service usage patterns** include Short Message Service (SMS), data sessions, and application usage analytics for comprehensive activity tracking.

Cell tower events and geo-locations stream in real time via [Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md). The following location data elements enable precise device positioning:

- **Cell tower identification** includes precise geographic coordinates and coverage areas for each tower in the network.

- **Device location triangulation** provides accurate positioning data derived from network infrastructure measurements.

- **Handover events** capture device movement between cell towers, enabling continuous location tracking.
