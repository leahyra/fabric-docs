# ISP analytics reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how to use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to ingest, enrich, analyze, and act on ISP telemetry at scale—processing more than 1 TB/hour of router logs alongside customer signals. By joining streaming events with operational context from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems (inventory, service plans, locations, and maintenance data), you can monitor network health in real time, investigate incidents faster, and predict emerging issues before they impact customers.

It also maps the end-to-end flow—from ingestion and enrichment to ML scoring and real-time dashboards, so you can adapt the pattern to your own network and operating model.

## Architecture overview 

The ISP analytics reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes high-volume router logs and customer data streams, enriched with ERP context to enable intelligent network operations. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform and enrich, Train and score, and Visualize and activate.

1. **Enrich streaming data** - Router logs are enriched in motion with customer details and operational context, creating analysis-ready datasets in real time.

1. **Aggregate for analytics** - Enriched data is aggregated in real time within Eventhouse, providing easy-to-query long-term views for network performance analysis.

1. **Train and score ML models** - Machine learning models are built and trained using Data Science, then deployed for real-time scoring to predict network issues and optimize performance.

1. **Visualize network health** - Real-Time Dashboards present live views of network usage with drill-down capabilities from system-wide metrics to individual router performance.

1. **Generate BI reports** - Power BI connects to Eventhouse via DirectQuery to deliver rich business intelligence reports on real-time and historical network data.

1. **Activate alerts** - Data Activator monitors router telemetry and generates real-time alerts on anomalies, threshold violations, and network issues.

1. **Enable ad-hoc analysis** - Network operations teams use Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries for deep investigations and root-cause analysis, reducing investigation time from hours to minutes.


## Operational phases

Operational phases describe how data moves through the solution from ingestion to action. Each phase represents a distinct stage of data processing, and together these phases form a complete pipeline that transforms raw telemetry into actionable intelligence. The phases highlight the primary Fabric experiences involved, the type of processing performed, and the outcomes you can expect—starting with streaming ingestion and contextual enrichment, then progressing through analytics and machine learning scoring, and ending with dashboards and automated alerts that support day-to-day network operations.

### Ingest and process 

The Ingest and process phase focuses on reliably capturing high-volume streaming telemetry and shaping it into analysis-ready events. During this phase, you bring router logs and customer/device signals into Fabric in near real time, apply basic validation and normalization, and ensure the data is available for downstream enrichment, analytics, and alerting. This foundation is critical because the quality and completeness of ingested data directly affects the accuracy of all downstream processing.

More than 1 TB/hour of router logs from customer endpoints are ingested through [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) (for example, via MQTT). This ingestion layer standardizes and routes events for downstream enrichment, analytics, and alerting. The following types of data are captured:

By addressing these considerations early in your planning process, you can implement the solution reliably at scale and avoid common pitfalls.

### Data architecture requirements 

A well-designed data architecture ensures that your system can handle high-volume telemetry while maintaining data quality and meeting latency requirements. Plan your ingestion, processing, and storage strategy carefully to support both real-time operations and long-term analytics needs.

- **High-throughput ingestion**: Your system should be designed to process more than 1 TB/hour of router logs reliably, with more burst capacity to handle peak network usage periods without data loss or degraded performance.

- **Real-time processing**: Critical network alerts require immediate response times, while performance monitoring needs subsecond latency to enable operators to detect and respond to network issues as they occur.

- **Data quality and validation**: You should implement real-time validation to ensure router log accuracy, customer data integrity, and correct network performance calculations, including automatic error correction mechanisms that maintain data quality without manual intervention.

- **Scalability planning**: The architecture should be designed to accommodate growing network infrastructure, an expanding customer base, and increasing data volumes without requiring significant rearchitecture.

- **Storage requirements**: Plan your storage strategy to support real-time logs, historical performance records, and customer analytics, with retention policies that balance operational needs against storage costs.

- **Network systems integration**: Your data architecture should include well-defined integration patterns for routers, MQTT protocols, and network management systems to ensure consistent data flow.

### Security and compliance 

Protecting customer and operational data is essential for maintaining trust and meeting regulatory obligations. Apply governance controls that address telecommunications industry requirements while enabling the operational agility your teams need to respond to network issues quickly.

- **Access controls**: You should implement role-based access control that aligns with your operational roles, require multifactor authentication for all users, and use privileged access management for sensitive infrastructure functions to limit exposure.

- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive audit logging is essential for compliance, and your implementation should capture network monitoring activities, customer data access, and system operations in logs that support regulatory reporting.

- **Data privacy**: Your implementation must ensure compliance with telecommunications regulations, customer privacy requirements, and data protection standards that apply to both network telemetry and customer information.

### Integration points 

Successful implementation depends on well-defined connections between the Fabric platform and your existing network systems and business applications. These integrations ensure that data and context remain synchronized across the entire solution, enabling the contextual enrichment that makes this architecture valuable.

- **Network infrastructure**: Your implementation should integrate directly with routers, switches, and other network equipment to collect performance logs and telemetry in real time without disrupting network operations.

- **MQTT protocols**: Customer devices and IoT endpoints communicate via MQTT, and your Eventstreams configuration should be optimized to handle the message patterns and volumes these devices generate.

- **ERP systems**: Integration with your ERP systems provides essential context for inventory management, technician scheduling, and network asset data that enriches streaming telemetry with business meaning.

- **Customer management**: Connections to billing systems, customer service platforms, and CRM systems enable you to correlate network performance with customer experience and business impact.

- **External data sources**: Your architecture should include integration points for external APIs that provide vendor system data, regulatory database information, and third-party network monitoring insights.

### Monitoring and observability 

Continuous monitoring of both platform health and data correctness helps you detect ingestion failures, processing bottlenecks, and cost drivers before they affect operations. A comprehensive observability strategy ensures that you can maintain system reliability while optimizing costs over time.

#### Operational monitoring

Operational monitoring tracks service health and end-to-end performance across ingestion, processing, and alerting components. This visibility helps your team identify and resolve issues before they affect downstream analytics or alerting.

- **System health dashboards**: You should monitor router log ingestion rates, Eventhouse processing performance, and Activator alert delivery continuously, with automated alerts that notify your team when system anomalies occur.

- **Data quality monitoring**: Continuous validation of incoming network data helps you identify communication failures, invalid performance indicators, or corrupted router information before bad data affects your analytics.

- **Performance metrics**: Track ingestion latency, machine learning model prediction accuracy, and dashboard response times against your defined SLAs to ensure the system meets operational requirements.

#### Cost optimization

Cost optimization requires balancing performance requirements against spending through careful capacity planning, appropriate retention policies, and lifecycle management aligned to your regulatory and operational needs.

- **Capacity management**: You should right-size your Fabric capacity based on actual data volumes and analytics complexity, configure autoscaling for peak usage periods, and optimize spending during low-activity windows.

- **Data lifecycle management**: Archiving older network data to lower-cost storage tiers, applying retention policies that align with regulatory requirements, and removing nonessential operational data help control storage costs over time.

- **Network operations optimization**: By correlating network performance metrics with operational costs, you can identify opportunities to minimize maintenance expenses while maximizing infrastructure efficiency.
