# Customer churn reference architecture 

Customer churn represents one of the most significant challenges facing businesses today. Every lost customer impacts revenue, increases acquisition costs, and diminishes lifetime value. Traditional batch-based analytics often identify at-risk customers too late for effective intervention, resulting in missed retention opportunities and preventable revenue loss.

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive customer churn analytics solutions that handle real-time streaming and batch CRM data, application logs, and user engagement data. You can process continuous customer behavior streams and integrate network metadata to enable intelligent churn prediction, customer lifecycle analysis, and proactive retention management. 

The architecture addresses the challenges of managing complex customer environments where CRM systems, applications, and user interaction platforms continuously generate massive data volumes. By implementing this solution, you can transform raw customer behavioral data into actionable insights that drive retention strategies, optimize customer lifetime value, and reduce churn rates through timely, personalized interventions.

## Architecture overview 

The customer churn reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time customer data streams and integrates network metadata for intelligent churn prediction and retention management. This architecture eliminates data silos by bringing together CRM data, application logs, user engagement signals, and customer feedback into a single analytics environment where machine learning models can identify churn risk and trigger automated retention actions.

You can implement the architecture with five main operational phases that work together to deliver end-to-end customer intelligence:

- **Ingest & process** - This phase captures real-time streaming and batch CRM data, application logs, and user engagement data from across your customer touchpoints.

- **Analyze, transform, & enrich** - This phase conducts customer feedback correlation, cohort analysis, and survival modeling with anomaly detection to understand customer behavior patterns.

- **Model & contextualize** - This phase builds relationship graphs and patterns across customer factors including geography, device usage, service tier, and temporal patterns for lifetime value calculation and churn risk scoring.

- **Train & score** - This phase develops predictive ML models for real-time churn prediction and generates personalized retention recommendations based on customer profiles.

- **Visualize & Activate** - This phase provides real-time dashboards for key performance indicator (KPI) monitoring and triggers automated proactive retention campaigns through personalized customer outreach.

## Operational phases

This section describes how data flows through each phase of the architecture, from initial ingestion through visualization and automated retention actions. Understanding these data flows helps you plan your implementation and optimizing performance for your specific customer analytics requirements.

### Ingest & process 

The ingestion phase captures all customer data streams and prepares them for real-time processing. This phase handles both streaming and batch data sources, requiring careful capacity planning to maintain performance during peak activity periods.

Real-time streaming and batch CRM data, application logs, and user engagement data are ingested via [Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md) and routed to [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md). This comprehensive data integration captures customer behavior information including the following data types:
