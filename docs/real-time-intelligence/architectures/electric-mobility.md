The following sections explain each operational phase in more detail.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

Route real-time charging station data to [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) for ingestion and enrichment. In parallel, the system processes energy cost rates through MQTT integration before routing them to Eventstreams.

The continuous data integration includes:

- **Live charging station telemetry** - Ingest real-time data from charging stations, including usage patterns, operational state, availability, and performance metrics.

- **Energy cost rates** - Stream real-time pricing data for cost optimization and billing calculations.

- **Station metadata and asset information** - Collect and update daily data on charging station specifications, installation locations, maintenance history, and hardware configurations.

During a typical day, a major charging network operator with 15,000 charging stations processes over 500,000 usage events. These events include charging session starts and stops, power consumption readings, connector status updates, payment transactions, and system diagnostics. Eventstreams handles this high-velocity data while applying real-time enrichment, such as adding station specifications, network topology, and maintenance schedules.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

Continuous transformations take place within [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md), where real-time charging station data is enriched with asset information stored in [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md). This process combines live telemetry with historical and contextual data to create fully curated, ready-for-consumption datasets. The enrichment pipeline enables immediate operational insights, including the following capabilities:

- **Station specifications and capabilities** - Integrate detailed metadata about charging station types, connector configurations, and power ratings to enhance operational context.

- **Location and network information** - Correlate real-time data with geographic and network topology details for precise situational awareness.

- **Historical performance patterns** - Analyze past usage trends and operational metrics to identify recurring problems or optimization opportunities.

- **Maintenance and service records** - Incorporate maintenance history and service schedules to predict and prevent equipment failures.

- **User behavior analytics** - Leverage insights into charging habits and preferences to improve customer experience and station utilization.

Aggregated usage data correlates with energy rates to provide a comprehensive view of operational costs and network performance. This view enables the following optimizations:

- **Real-time cost calculations** - Perform immediate billing and pricing adjustments based on live energy consumption and rate data.

- **Usage pattern analysis** - Identify peak demand periods and forecast future usage trends to optimize resource allocation.

- **Network optimization** - Balance loads dynamically across the network to prevent congestion and maximize efficiency.

- **Performance monitoring** - Track key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time to detect anomalies and ensure operational excellence.

### Train

 You can build, train, and score machine learning models in real time by using [Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md) capabilities within Microsoft Fabric. These models analyze both historical and real-time data to provide predictive insights that enhance network operations. Key predictive capabilities include:

- **Usage prediction models** - Leverage historical and real-time data to forecast charging demand across different locations, times of day, and seasons. These models help operators anticipate peak usage periods, optimize resource allocation, and ensure sufficient station availability during high-demand intervals. For example, the system can predict increased demand near shopping centers during weekends or in residential areas during evening hours.

- **Station availability forecasting** - Use predictive analytics to determine the optimal placement of new charging stations and assess capacity needs for existing ones. By analyzing usage trends, geographic data, and network performance, operators can identify underserved areas and strategically expand the network to maximize coverage and minimize congestion.

- **Maintenance prediction** - Implement machine learning models to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. These models analyze historical maintenance records, real-time performance metrics, and environmental factors to identify potential problems before they occur. Proactive maintenance reduces downtime, extends equipment lifespan, and minimizes operational disruptions.

- **Energy cost optimization** - Develop predictive models to optimize pricing strategies based on demand patterns, energy market conditions, and grid availability. By forecasting energy costs and usage trends, operators can implement dynamic pricing to balance load, reduce operational expenses, and maximize revenue during peak periods.

- **User behavior analytics** - Analyze charging patterns and customer preferences to enhance the user experience. Insights from these analytics can inform decisions on station placement, pricing strategies, and service offerings. For instance, understanding that users prefer faster charging options during short stops can guide investments in high-speed chargers at specific locations.

### Visualize and activate

[Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction.md) in Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence triggers automated actions based on real-time data insights. This feature enables proactive network management and enhances operational efficiency by reducing manual intervention. Key actions include:

- **Immediate fault response** - Automatically detect and alert field technicians about station malfunctions or service interruptions. For example, if a charging station reports a connector fault or power failure, the system sends an immediate notification to the responsible team for quick resolution, minimizing downtime and customer inconvenience.

- **Proactive maintenance** - Generate preventive notifications based on predictive analytics to address potential equipment failures before they occur. For instance, if a charging station shows signs of wear or irregular performance metrics, the system alerts maintenance teams to schedule repairs, reducing the risk of unexpected outages.

- **Performance optimization** - Implement real-time adjustments to enhance network efficiency and improve customer experience. For example, dynamically balance the load across charging stations during peak hours to prevent congestion and ensure optimal utilization of available resources.

- **Safety alerts** - Trigger immediate notifications for safety-critical issues that require urgent response. For example, if a charging station detects overheating or a potential electrical hazard, the system alerts operators and field technicians to take corrective action, ensuring user safety and compliance with safety standards.

Your charging network operations teams use [Power BI dashboards](../create-powerbi-report.md) connected directly to Eventhouse and OneLake to monitor live charging patterns, revenue trends, and network performance through unified analytical views, including:

- **Usage analytics** - Analyze charging patterns, customer behavior, and station utilization trends to optimize station placement and improve user experience. For example, identify peak usage times at specific locations to allocate resources effectively.

- **Revenue analysis** - Track financial performance, pricing strategies, and revenue growth across the network. For instance, evaluate the impact of dynamic pricing on revenue during high-demand periods.

- **Network performance** - Monitor operational efficiency, station availability, and fault detection metrics. For example, identify underperforming stations and take corrective actions to improve uptime and reliability.

- **Predictive insights** - Generate forecasts for capacity planning, network expansion, and maintenance scheduling. For example, predict future demand in underserved areas to prioritize new station deployments and ensure optimal coverage.

[Real-Time Dashboard](../real-time-dashboards-overview.md) provides live operational visibility with customizable views for different operational roles, enabling teams to monitor and respond to real-time events effectively. These dashboards provide the following capabilities:

- **Network overview** - Gain a comprehensive view of all charging stations with real-time status updates, including operational state, availability, and fault detection. For example, operators can quickly identify underperforming stations or areas with high demand.

- **Station-level monitoring** - Access detailed insights into individual station performance, including usage patterns, energy consumption, and maintenance history. For instance, monitor a specific station's uptime and identify trends in customer usage to optimize resource allocation.

- **Socket-level details** - Drill down into granular monitoring of each charging connector and session, such as tracking the duration of charging sessions, energy delivered, and connector status. For example, identify sockets with frequent malfunctions to prioritize repairs.

- **Operational metrics** - Track real-time KPIs for network efficiency, station availability, and revenue generation. For example, monitor metrics like average charging time, peak usage hours, and revenue per station to make data-driven decisions for network optimization.

[KQL Copilot](../copilot-writing-queries.md) enables you to use natural language queries to quickly check the status of charging stations, identify potential operational problems, and explore real-time data without requiring complex coding. Additionally, you can train KQL Copilot to aggregate and evaluate charging utilization patterns, providing deeper operational insights for optimizing station availability and network performance.
