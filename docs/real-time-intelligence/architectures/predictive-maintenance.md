# Predictive maintenance reference architecture

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive predictive maintenance solutions that handle real-time data from factory floor devices with subsecond latency. You can process IIoT events streaming from manufacturing equipment and integrate contextualization data including technician shifts, asset maintenance history, and component costs to enable intelligent maintenance operations and equipment failure prediction capabilities.

You can manage complex maintenance operations where factory floor devices continuously stream operational data including equipment status, performance metrics, and health indicators. The architecture integrates daily collected contextualization data through MQTT-Eventstream integration and maintains comprehensive asset metadata linked to OneLake for unified predictive maintenance intelligence.

## Architecture overview

The predictive maintenance reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from factory floor devices and integrates operational contextualization data for intelligent maintenance management.

The following diagram shows the key components and data flows in this architecture. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases, each building on the previous to deliver comprehensive predictive maintenance capabilities:

- **Ingest & process**: This phase captures real-time IIoT events from factory floor devices and integrates contextualization data from maintenance systems.
- **Analyze & transform**: This phase enriches and contextualizes events with asset information and generates real-time aggregated views for analysis.
- **Train**: This phase builds advanced predictive ML models for real-time scoring and maintenance prediction capabilities.
- **Visualize & Activate**: This phase provides deep analytics, real-time dashboards, and automated notifications for maintenance operations.

## Operational phases

This section describes each operational phase in detail, explaining the data flows, processing steps, and capabilities enabled at each stage of the predictive maintenance pipeline.

### Ingest & process

IIoT events are streamed from factory floor devices in subsecond latency, providing immediate visibility into equipment health, performance indicators, and operational metrics critical for predictive maintenance. This real-time data stream is captured through [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) and processed in [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md) for immediate analysis and maintenance prediction.

Contextualization data including technicians' shifts, asset maintenance history, component costs, and operational parameters are collected daily using MQTT-Eventstream integration, enabling comprehensive maintenance intelligence and cost optimization for equipment operations.

Asset metadata and PLC information are linked to [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) for unified maintenance data management. The following types of data are stored in OneLake:

- Equipment specifications and maintenance requirements define the operating parameters and service needs for each asset.
- Asset hierarchies and maintenance dependencies map the relationships between equipment and their maintenance schedules.
- Historical maintenance records and failure patterns provide the foundation for predictive model training.
- Technician shift schedules and maintenance workforce allocation data enables optimal resource planning.
- Component costs and replacement part inventory support maintenance cost analysis and budget planning.

**Real-world scenario example**: manufacturing facility processes subsecond IIoT events from critical equipment including pumps, motors, conveyors, and production machinery. Daily MQTT integration collects contextualization data from computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), workforce scheduling platforms, and spare parts inventory systems to provide comprehensive predictive maintenance capabilities and optimal maintenance resource allocation.

### Analyze & transform

In this phase, events are enriched and contextualized with asset information on-the-fly. This enrichment provides comprehensive maintenance intelligence by combining real-time equipment data with the following contextual information:
