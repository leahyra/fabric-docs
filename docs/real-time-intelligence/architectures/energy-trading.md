# Energy trading management reference architecture

This reference architecture shows how to use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive energy trading management solutions that handle real-time data from energy generation facilities, grid consumption networks, and market trading platforms. You can process real-time manufacturing data from wind turbines and power plants, grid consumption events, and smart meter telemetry to enable intelligent energy trading operations with predictive analytics and real-time decision making. 

You can manage large-scale energy trading operations where thousands of energy generation sources and smart meters stream real-time data on production metrics, consumption patterns, and market conditions. The architecture integrates CRM contextualization data through MQTT streaming and maintains comprehensive metadata and asset information on various types of energy infrastructure to create a unified energy trading platform.

## Architecture overview

The energy trading management reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from energy generation facilities, consumption networks, and trading markets for intelligent energy trading management. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform, and enrich, Train, and Visualize and activate.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

Ingest real-time telemetry data from energy manufacturing facilities, including wind turbines and power plants, by using [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md). Process IoT events with subsecond latency to provide comprehensive visibility into energy generation capacity and production metrics for trading optimization. Integrate grid load distribution and demand pattern data in real time to deliver actionable market intelligence.

- Operational state and generation metrics
- Grid load distribution and demand patterns
- Energy production baselines and performance metrics
- Maintenance and service history
- Asset lifecycle and operational efficiency trends
- Predictive analytics for energy generation optimization

Integrate CRM contextualization data through MQTT-Eventstream, delivering real-time updates on smart meter IDs, customer address information, and consumption profiles. This data enables enhanced trading analytics and customer segmentation.

Collect and synchronize inventory and asset information from ERP systems into [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) by using [Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md). Update metadata daily, including:

- Energy generation facility specifications and trading capacity ratings
- Smart meter installations and customer trading profiles
- Grid infrastructure topology and market connection details
- Asset lifecycle information and trading performance history

A major energy trading company that manages 150,000 smart meters and 500 energy generation facilities processes over 15 million energy events per day. These events include power generation readings, grid consumption data, smart meter telemetry, and market pricing information. The MQTT-Eventstream integration processes this data while maintaining subsecond latency for critical trading decisions and market optimization.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich 

Continuous transformations take place within [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md), where real-time energy generation data from producers is enriched with asset metadata stored in [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md).
