# Fleet management reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how to use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive fleet management solutions that handle millions of telemetry events from hundreds of thousands of vehicles. You can process real-time vehicle location data, mechanical state information, and operational metrics to enable intelligent fleet operations with advanced predictive capabilities and real-time decision making.

You can handle massive scale fleet operations where hundreds of thousands of vehicles generate millions of telemetry events per hour. These events provide critical details on vehicle location, mechanical state, driver behavior, and operational performance. The architecture integrates ERP system data including service station locations, delivery points, driver schedules, and vehicle details to create a unified fleet management platform.

## Architecture overview

The following sections explain each operational phase in detail.

## Operational phases

### Ingestion and process

Ingest real-time telemetry data from fleet vehicles and process it by using [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md). Integrate operational data in real time through MQTT-[Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md), delivering continuous updates on vehicle location, mechanical state, and driver behavior. This seamless data integration provides a comprehensive view of fleet performance, enabling operational optimization and predictive analytics.

- Vehicle location and mechanical state
- Driver behavior and operational performance
- Service station locations and delivery points
- Driver schedules and vehicle metadata
- Traffic and weather condition correlations
- Predictive analytics for maintenance optimization
- Historical trends for fleet efficiency

Collect and update metadata and asset information on fleet vehicles daily into [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md), including:

- Vehicle specifications and maintenance history
- Driver profiles and schedules
- Route assignments and delivery requirements
- Service station locations and fuel pricing
- Traffic and weather condition data

A large logistics company with 250,000 delivery vehicles processes over 15 million telemetry events per hour during peak operations. These events include GPS coordinates every 30 seconds, engine diagnostics, fuel consumption, delivery confirmations, traffic conditions, and driver status updates. The MQTT-Eventhouse integration processes this data while maintaining subsecond latency for critical operational decisions and fleet optimization.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

Continuous transformations take place within [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md), where real-time telemetry data from fleet vehicles is enriched with asset metadata stored in [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md). This enrichment process creates fully curated, ready-for-consumption data by combining telemetry with the following information:

- **Vehicle specifications and maintenance history**: Include detailed information about each vehicle in the fleet, such as make, model, year, engine type, and capacity. Maintenance history covers past repairs, service schedules, and component replacements to ensure accurate predictive maintenance.

- **Driver profiles and schedules**: Maintain comprehensive profiles for each driver, including their certifications, driving history, and performance metrics. Schedules outline assigned routes, shift timings, and planned breaks to optimize fleet operations.

- **Route assignments and delivery requirements**: Define specific routes for each vehicle, including waypoints, delivery locations, and estimated arrival times. Delivery requirements specify cargo details, handling instructions, and priority levels for time-sensitive shipments.

- **Service station locations and fuel pricing**: Map out service station locations along fleet routes, including details on available services such as refueling, maintenance, and rest areas. Include real-time fuel pricing data to optimize refueling strategies and reduce operational costs.

- **Weather and traffic condition data**: Integrate real-time weather forecasts and traffic updates to enhance route planning and operational decision-making. This data helps mitigate delays caused by adverse conditions and ensures driver safety.

Vehicle events are aggregated with daily and weekly views for long-term retention and historical analysis, enabling trend identification and performance optimization across the entire fleet operation.

### Train

Build, train, and score advanced machine learning models in real time by using [Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md) capabilities to predict vehicle behavior. These models continuously learn from incoming telemetry data and historical data patterns to provide actionable insights. Key predictive capabilities include:

- **Predictive maintenance models** - Use advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast potential component failures in vehicles before they occur. These models analyze historical maintenance data, real-time telemetry, and environmental conditions to predict when specific parts are likely to fail. This prediction enables proactive scheduling of maintenance activities, reducing unplanned downtime and extending the lifespan of fleet assets.

- **Route optimization algorithms** - Leverage predictive analytics to determine the most efficient delivery routes for vehicles. These algorithms consider real-time traffic data, historical traffic patterns, weather conditions, and vehicle performance metrics to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. This approach ensures timely deliveries while optimizing operational costs.

- **Fuel efficiency models** - Analyze telemetry data to identify patterns in fuel consumption across the fleet. These models highlight inefficiencies caused by factors such as suboptimal driving behavior, vehicle maintenance issues, or route selection. By addressing these inefficiencies, organizations can reduce fuel costs and lower their carbon footprint.

- **Driver performance analytics** - Evaluate driving patterns and behaviors to enhance safety and operational efficiency. These analytics assess metrics such as acceleration, braking, speed, and adherence to routes. Use insights from this analysis to provide targeted training for drivers, improve compliance with safety standards, and reduce the risk of accidents.

- **Demand forecasting** - Predict fleet capacity requirements for various operational scenarios by using historical data and external factors such as seasonal trends, market demand, and economic conditions. These forecasts help organizations allocate resources effectively, ensuring that fleet operations are aligned with business needs while avoiding overcapacity or underutilization.

### Visualize and activate

[Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction.md) in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence generates real-time notifications on anomalous vehicle behavior, traffic conditions, weather alerts, and road conditions. By using this real-time awareness, the system reduces manual intervention and enables swift responses to critical situations. Key alerting capabilities include:

- **Immediate response to emergencies** - Automatically generate alerts for vehicle breakdowns, accidents, or other critical incidents. These alerts enable fleet managers to dispatch assistance promptly, minimizing downtime and ensuring driver safety.

- **Proactive route adjustments** - Dynamically reroute vehicles in real time based on traffic congestion, road closures, or adverse weather conditions. This capability helps maintain delivery schedules and optimize fuel efficiency.

- **Maintenance notifications** - Provide preventive alerts for potential component failures by analyzing telemetry data and predictive maintenance models. These notifications allow for timely repairs, reducing unplanned downtime and extending vehicle lifespan.

- **Delivery optimization** - Adjust delivery routes and schedules in real time to meet customer commitments. This adjustment includes prioritizing time-sensitive shipments, reallocating resources, and ensuring on-time deliveries even in changing operational conditions.

Fleet managers can use [Power BI dashboards](../create-powerbi-report.md) integrated with Eventhouse and OneLake to gain actionable insights into fleet operations in real time. These dashboards provide a robust set of reporting capabilities to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency:
