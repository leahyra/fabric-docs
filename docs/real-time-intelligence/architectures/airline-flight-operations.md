# Airline flight operations reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how you can use Microsoft Fabric to build a comprehensive flight operations analytics solution. You can handle real-time data from air traffic control systems, aircraft sensors, weather monitoring systems, and passenger management systems to ensure safe, efficient operations while delivering exceptional passenger experiences.

You can source real-time and historical airline flight operations data from multiple places, including air traffic feeds, flight trackers, and weather sources. IoT sensors on aircraft and ground operations provide updates on engine health, baggage handling, and turnaround times. Passenger and airport systems feed check-in, boarding, and gate information into the pipeline.

## Architecture overview

This reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric to create a unified analytics platform that processes real-time operational data and enables intelligent decision-making. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, train, and enrich, Train, and Visualize and activate.

1. Real-time and historical airline flight operations data is sourced from multiple places including air traffic feeds, flight trackers, and weather sources. IoT sensors on aircraft and ground operations provide
updates on engine health, baggage handling, and turnaround times. Passenger and airport systems feed check-
in, boarding, and gate information into the pipeline.​
1. Live telemetry is routed to Eventstream for ingestions and enrichments. In parallel, environmental data is processed through Azure Event Hubs before routing to Eventstream.​
1. ​Eventhouse receives real-time flight operation data from Eventstreams, ingesting information such as delays, maintenance alerts, and passenger status updates. It then applies rules to detect anomalies, helping airlines quickly identify and respond to operational disruptions.​
1. This data is then transformed and sent to OneLake, where analysts can query historical trends, such as identifying airports with frequent weather-related disruptions or monitoring aircraft turnaround efficiency. By correlating real-time alerts from Eventhouse with historical insights in OneLake, airlines can optimize flight schedules, improve resource allocation, and proactively mitigate operational risks. ​
1. Processed data is routed to Real-Time Dashboard and Power BI. ​
1. NL Copilot AI is used to quickly check the status of flights affected by bad weather, determine potential delays, and query real-time data without complex coding. It can also be built and trained to aggregate and analyze utilization patterns for better operational insights.​
1. Flight operations teams use Power BI to monitor live flight patterns, delays, and airspace congestion.
1. Automated alerts via Activator update passengers, reassign gates, and trigger maintenance actions. ​
1. Copilot AI provides instant insights, helping teams proactively manage disruptions and optimize airline performance.​

The following sections explain each operational phase in more detail.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

You route live telemetry to [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) for ingestion and enrichment. In parallel, the system processes environmental data through Azure Event Hubs before routing it to Eventstreams.

The continuous data integration includes:

- **Live flight telemetry** - Ingest real-time data from aircraft systems, including position updates, speed, altitude, and engine performance metrics.
- **Airline and airport operation systems** - Collect data from passenger management systems, baggage handling systems, gate assignments, and crew scheduling systems.
- **Weather and environmental data** - Integrate real-time weather updates, NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen), and air traffic control advisories.

During a typical day, a major airline processes more than 2 million operational events. These events include aircraft position updates every 30 seconds, passenger check-in events, baggage tracking updates, gate assignments, crew scheduling changes, and weather updates. Eventstreams handles this high-velocity data while applying real-time enrichment such as adding aircraft type information, route details, and passenger connection data.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

Continuous transformations take place within [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md), where KQL Query processes petabytes of streaming data to detect anomalies such as duplicate flight records, missing passenger details, or incorrect baggage routing codes and flag them for resolution. This real-time processing enables immediate airline operational optimization, including the following capabilities:

- [**Anomaly detection**](../anomaly-detection.md) - Eventhouse continuously monitors flight operations data to identify deviations from expected patterns, such as unexpected delays, maintenance alerts, or passenger flow issues in real-time. These anomalies are flagged as they occur, allowing operations teams to respond quickly and correct issues before they escalate.
- **Data validation** - Real-time validation verifies incoming data against predefined rules, such as ensuring flight numbers conform to IATA standards, passenger identification numbers are valid, and baggage routing codes match expected formats. Invalid data is flagged for correction, ensuring high data quality for downstream analytics.
- **Pattern recognition** - Eventhouse applies machine learning models to recognize patterns in flight operations data, such as recurring delay causes, maintenance trends, or passenger behavior patterns. These insights help airlines optimize operations and improve service quality.
- **Quality assurance** - Continuous monitoring of data quality metrics, such as completeness, accuracy, and timeliness, ensures that flight operations data meets established standards. Alerts are generated for any quality issues, enabling proactive resolution.

A shortcut is created between [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md) and [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md) to enable seamless data flow for historical analysis. By correlating real-time alerts from Eventhouse with historical insights in OneLake, the following optimizations are enabled:

- **Flight schedule optimization** - Analyze historical delay patterns alongside real-time alerts to adjust flight schedules dynamically, minimizing disruptions and improving on-time performance.
- **Resource allocation** - Use historical data on aircraft utilization and passenger flow to optimize gate assignments, crew scheduling, and ground operations in response to real-time events.
- **Predictive maintenance** - Combine real-time maintenance alerts with historical aircraft performance data to predict component failures and schedule proactive maintenance, reducing downtime.
- **Disruption mitigation** - Leverage historical weather impact data alongside real-time weather alerts to implement proactive contingency plans, such as rerouting flights or adjusting departure times.

### Train

Machine learning models are built, trained, and scored in real-time by using [Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md) capabilities within Microsoft Fabric. These models analyze both historical and real-time flight operations data to predict disruptions and optimize operations. Key use cases include:

- **Delay prediction** - Train models to predict flight delays based on historical patterns, weather conditions, and real-time operational data. These predictions help airlines proactively manage schedules and communicate with passengers.
- **Passenger flow optimization** - Analyze passenger check-in and boarding data to optimize processes, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall travel experience.
- **Maintenance forecasting** - Use historical maintenance records and real-time sensor data to forecast maintenance needs, enabling proactive scheduling and reducing unexpected aircraft downtime.
- **Route optimization** - Analyze historical flight paths and real-time air traffic data to optimize routes, reducing fuel consumption and improving on-time performance.
- **Crew scheduling** - Optimize crew assignments based on historical workload patterns and real-time operational demands, ensuring compliance with regulations while maximizing efficiency.
- **Baggage handling efficiency** - Use historical baggage tracking data and real-time updates to streamline baggage handling processes, reducing mishandling rates and improving passenger satisfaction.

### Visualize and activate

[Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction.md) in Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence triggers automated actions based on real-time flight operations data. With this real-time awareness and automated response, the system reduces manual intervention and helps maintain smooth operations. These actions include:

- **Passenger notifications** - Automatically send real-time updates to passengers regarding flight status changes, delays, gate assignments, and boarding information via SMS, email, or mobile app notifications.
- **Gate reassignments** - Trigger automatic gate changes based on real-time operational data, such as delays or aircraft availability, ensuring efficient use of airport resources.
- **Maintenance alerts** - Generate real-time maintenance alerts for ground crews based on aircraft sensor data, enabling prompt responses to potential issues and minimizing turnaround times.
- **Crew scheduling adjustments** - Automatically adjust crew assignments in response to real-time flight delays or cancellations, ensuring compliance with regulations while maintaining operational efficiency.
- **Baggage handling updates** - Trigger real-time updates to baggage handling systems based on flight status changes, reducing mishandling rates and improving passenger satisfaction.
- **Weather response** - Activate contingency plans when weather conditions deteriorate, trigger flight rerouting procedures, and coordinate with airport authorities for operational adjustments.

Your flight operations teams use [Power BI](../create-powerbi-report.md) dashboards connected directly to Eventhouse and OneLake to monitor live flight patterns, delays, and airspace congestion through unified analytical views, including:

- **Operational dashboards** - Real-time dashboards provide live visibility into flight operations, including on-time performance, delay causes, and resource utilization.
