# Hospital operations reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive hospital operations solutions that handle real-time Electronic Health Records (EHR) data and Admission, Discharge, Transfer (ADT) feeds from multiple healthcare sources. You can process continuous hospital operations data streams and integrate Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) data to enable intelligent patient flow monitoring, operational surge prediction, and automated hospital management optimization. 

You can manage complex hospital operations where EHR systems, patient movement tracking, and revenue cycle management systems continuously generate data on patient encounters, bed occupancy, and operational metrics. The architecture integrates real-time hospital data through Eventstreams processing and maintains comprehensive clinical systems data including lab results, imaging, and medication orders for unified hospital operations intelligence and predictive surge management. 

Unlike traditional batch-based analytics architectures, hospital operations require second-by-second visibility into patient movement, capacity constraints, and care coordination. Delays in detecting bed shortages, admission surges, or discharge bottlenecks can directly impact patient safety, care quality, and financial performance. This architecture emphasizes streaming ingestion, low-latency analytics, and automated activation to support continuous operational decision-making.
 
## Architecture overview  

The hospital operations reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from hospital systems and integrates digital twin representations for intelligent operations management. You can implement the architecture with five main operational phases:

1. The ingested Eventstream data is sent to Eventhouse for further processing, enabling streaming analytics and anomaly detection.

1. A shortcut is created between Eventhouse to OneLake where the clinical systems including lab results, imaging, and medication orders are captured to enrich patient context.

1. Continuous transformations take place within Eventhouse where Kusto Query Language (KQL) Query queries petabytes of data to detect anomalies like duplicate entries or missing billing codes, flagging them for resolution. 

1. Digital Twin Builder constructs digital representations of hospital operations, including bed occupancy, staffing levels, and patient flow.

1. Build, train, and score ML models in real time, to better predict potential surges and spikes.

1. Hospital administrators use Real-Time Dashboard to visualize customized  live updates of hospital operations. 

1. Activator is used to get real-time alerts on bed occupancy and admission surges, enabling timely adjustments and preventing delays.

1. Power BI dashboards—connected directly to OneLake and Eventhouse—monitors reimbursement cycle times and revenue trends.

1. By using Copilot, analysts can ask natural language questions.
