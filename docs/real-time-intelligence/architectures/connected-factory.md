# Connected factory reference architecture 

This reference architecture shows how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build connected factory solutions that handle real-time data from industrial IoT devices across multiple manufacturing facilities. You can process more than 1 million IIoT events per hour from 30,000 tags across 40 factories to enable intelligent manufacturing operations with predictive analytics and real-time decision making.

You can manage large-scale manufacturing operations where thousands of industrial devices stream real-time data on production metrics, equipment performance, and operational state. The architecture integrates contextualization data from OPCUA libraries via MQTT streaming and maintains comprehensive factory inventory, shift details, and cost information to create a unified connected factory platform.

## Architecture overview

The connected factory reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from industrial IoT devices and integrates factory contextualization data for intelligent manufacturing management. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform, and enrich, Train, and Visualize and activate.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

You can stream over 1 million IIoT events per hour from 30,000 tags across 40 factories in real time with subsecond latency. This streaming provides comprehensive visibility into manufacturing processes, equipment performance, and production metrics. Ingest this data through [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) and store it in [Eventhouse](../eventhouse.md) for immediate analysis.

Collect contextualization data on the IIoT devices from the OPCUA library daily via MQTT. This data enables real-time asset identification, equipment specifications, and operational parameters for enhanced manufacturing insights. 

Synchronize factory inventory, shift details, and component cost information to [OneLake](../onelake/onelake-overview.md) via [Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md) for data enrichment and contextualization. This synchronization includes: 

- **Manufacturing equipment specifications and performance baselines**: Include detailed information about each piece of equipment, such as operational parameters, performance thresholds, and maintenance history. This data helps in identifying deviations from normal operating conditions and optimizing equipment utilization.

- **Production line configurations and asset hierarchies**: Document the layout and structure of production lines, including the relationships between assets, stations, and processes. This hierarchical data enables better contextualization of real-time events and facilitates root cause analysis.

- **Shift schedules and workforce allocation details**: Provide insights into workforce planning, including shift timings, roles, and responsibilities. This information is crucial for correlating production metrics with workforce efficiency and identifying potential bottlenecks.

- **Component costs and inventory management information**: Track the costs of raw materials, components, and finished goods alongside inventory levels. This data supports real-time cost analysis, supply chain optimization, and efficient resource allocation.

**Real-world scenario example**: A major manufacturing conglomerate with 40 factories processes over 1 million IIoT events per hour from 30,000 industrial tags. These events include temperature readings from furnaces, pressure measurements from hydraulic systems, vibration data from rotating machinery, production counts from assembly lines, and quality metrics from inspection stations. The MQTT-Eventstream integration processes this data while maintaining subsecond latency for critical manufacturing decisions and real-time production optimization.
