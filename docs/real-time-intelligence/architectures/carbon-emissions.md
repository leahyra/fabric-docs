# Carbon emissions management reference architecture 

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive carbon emissions management solutions that handle real-time data from emission measurement devices across power plants and industrial facilities. You can process real-time emissions telemetry, carbon market data, and asset performance metrics to enable intelligent environmental compliance operations with predictive analytics and real-time decision making. 

You can manage large-scale carbon emissions monitoring where hundreds or thousands of measurement devices stream real-time data on emission levels, gas compositions, and environmental impact metrics. The architecture integrates carbon market data via real-time streaming and maintains comprehensive metadata and asset information on various types of industrial equipment to create a unified carbon emissions platform. 

## Architecture overview 

The carbon emissions management reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from emission measurement devices and integrates carbon market intelligence for comprehensive environmental management. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases: Ingest and process, Analyze, transform, and enrich, Train, and Visualize and activate.

## Operational phases

### Ingest and process

Use [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) to ingest real-time telemetry data from emission measurement devices in power plants and industrial facilities. This data includes carbon output levels, gas compositions, and environmental impact metrics. Process IoT events with subsecond latency to provide comprehensive visibility into emissions data and environmental performance. Integrate asset metadata, regulatory compliance requirements, and carbon market data in real time to deliver actionable insights for environmental optimization and compliance tracking.

Use [Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md) to collect and synchronize asset metadata, gas, and oil prices from ERP systems into [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md). This metadata includes: 

- Power plant specifications and emission capacity ratings 
- Industrial equipment configurations and environmental baselines 
- Regulatory compliance requirements and reporting schedules 
- Energy source costs and carbon footprint calculations 

**Real-world scenario example**: A major industrial conglomerate with 75 power plants and 200 manufacturing facilities processes over 8 million emission measurement events per day. These events include CO2 levels, NOx readings, particulate matter concentrations, methane emissions, and energy consumption metrics. The MQTT-Eventstream integration processes this data while maintaining subsecond latency for critical environmental compliance decisions and regulatory reporting requirements.

### Analyze, transform, and enrich

Enrich and contextualize emissions data with the asset metadata to create curated tables that are easy to use. This enrichment process combines real-time emissions telemetry with:

- **Environmental specifications and baselines:** Detailed emission capacity ratings, equipment configurations, and operational thresholds for compliance tracking. This combination enables accurate emissions assessment against regulatory standards.
  
- **Regulatory jurisdiction information:** Geographic coordinates, local environmental regulations, and jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements. This information enables real-time adherence to diverse regulatory frameworks.

- **Historical performance patterns:** Multi-year trends, seasonal variations, and past regulatory audit outcomes help you detect anomalies, forecast compliance risks, and optimize environmental strategies.

- **Operational records and maintenance schedules:** Detailing equipment performance metrics, maintenance history, and operational anomalies impacting emissions. This detail enables predictive maintenance and emissions optimization.

- **Energy source correlation analytics:** Analyzing the relationship between energy sources (for example, coal, natural gas, renewables) and their respective carbon emissions impact. This analysis helps optimize energy sourcing strategies for sustainability and cost efficiency.

You can materialize and aggregate data in real time for a long-term aggregative view, enabling comprehensive environmental impact assessment and regulatory compliance tracking. This view enables: 

- **Real-time compliance monitoring** - Immediate emissions threshold tracking and regulatory adherence.

- **Environmental impact analysis** - Detailed carbon footprint assessment and sustainability metrics.

- **Market correlation** - Carbon credit optimization and environmental trading strategies.

- **Predictive compliance** - Proactive emissions management and regulatory risk mitigation.

### Train

By using [Data Science](../../data-science/data-science-overview.md) capabilities, you can build, train, and score machine learning models in real time. These models provide detection and prediction on emissions spikes, including:

- **Emissions spike detection models** - Identify anomalous emission levels and environmental violations.

- **Compliance forecasting** - Predict regulatory compliance status and optimize reporting strategies.

- **Carbon market optimization** - Anticipate carbon credit needs and trading opportunities.

Rich [Power BI](../create-powerbi-report.md) reports provide live, high granularity operational visibility into carbon emissions data, enabling teams to make informed decisions in real time. These reports offer:

- **Emissions analytics** - Comprehensive reporting on carbon emission patterns and environmental trends.

- **Compliance performance** - Environmental regulatory tracking and sustainability metrics analysis.

- **Market intelligence** - Carbon credit analysis and environmental trading optimization insights.

- **Business impact insights** - High-level business reports providing yearly and monthly view on carbon emission impact on the business.

By using [Activator](../data-activator/activator-introduction.md), you can generate real-time notifications on emissions anomalies and on in-flight data, enabling: 

- **Immediate compliance response** - Automatic alerts for emissions threshold violations and regulatory issues.

- **Proactive anomaly management** - Preventive notifications for predicted environmental violations.

- **Market optimization** - Real-time adjustments for carbon credit trading and environmental compliance.

- **Emergency response** - Immediate notifications for critical emissions incidents requiring urgent environmental action.

By using [KQL copilot](../copilot-writing-queries.md), you can use natural language queries to interact with real-time carbon emissions data without needing to write complex KQL queries. Additionally, you can train KQL Copilot to aggregate and evaluate utilization patterns, providing deeper operational insights.
