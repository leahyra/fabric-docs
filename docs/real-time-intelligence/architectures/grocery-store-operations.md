# Grocery store operations reference architecture

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive grocery store operations solutions that handle real-time IoT sensor data from refrigerated and frozen storage units across multiple store locations. You can process continuous temperature monitoring data and integrate environmental conditions to enable intelligent food safety compliance, proactive maintenance scheduling, and seamless customer shopping experiences.

You can manage complex multi-location grocery operations where IoT sensors continuously monitor temperature levels across refrigerated and frozen storage units while integrating environmental data to predict external impacts on downstream temperature readings. The architecture provides real-time processing through Eventstreams and comprehensive analytics for proactive maintenance and food safety compliance.

## Architecture overview

The grocery store operations reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time IoT sensor data from refrigeration systems and integrates environmental data for intelligent grocery store management. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases:

:::image type="content" source="./media/grocery-store-operations.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the grocery store operations reference architecture." lightbox="./media/grocery-store-operations.svg":::

1. **IoT sensors** installed in refrigerated and frozen storage units continuously monitor temperature levels across the grocery store.

1. Additionally, **Azure Event Hubs** collects environmental data to predict how external conditions impact downstream temperature readings from all store locations.

1. The data is then ingested to **Eventstreams** where the incoming temperature data undergoes real-time processing.

1. The system sends temperature data to **Eventhouse** for storage and processing. Set alerts for anomalies to identify refrigeration units that experience frequent temperature spikes, allowing for proactive maintenance scheduling.

1. Natural Language **Copilot** enables store associates and analysts to generate and execute queries on temperature fluctuations over time.

1. Using **Real-Time Dashboard**, store managers and regional supervisors can monitor refrigeration performance across multiple locations, track trends, and assess compliance with food safety regulations.

1. Grocery store managers use **Activator** to set up real-time alerts for temperature deviations beyond the set thresholds, prompting immediate inspections. This proactive alerting system enhances food safety compliance and ensures a seamless shopping experience for customers.

## Operational phases

The operational phases describe how the architecture delivers end-to-end, real-time grocery store operations - from capturing environmental signals to activating automated responses and analyst workflows. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring that raw events are continuously monitored and compliance achieved.

### Ingest and process

IoT sensors installed in refrigerated and frozen storage units continuously monitor temperature levels across the grocery store, providing real-time visibility into critical food storage conditions. This continuous monitoring captures temperature data from:

- Refrigerated display cases and storage areas
- Frozen food storage units and walk-in freezers
- Dairy and produce refrigeration systems
- Temperature-sensitive medication storage areas
- Cold storage and preparation areas

To collect environmental data that predicts how external conditions impact downstream temperature readings from all store locations, use [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/). This environmental data includes:

- External weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
- Humidity levels and atmospheric pressure changes
- Seasonal variations and climate patterns
- Store traffic and door opening frequency
- HVAC system performance and energy consumption

**Real-world scenario example**: A grocery chain with more than 150 locations processes continuous temperature data from thousands of IoT sensors monitoring refrigerated and frozen storage units. [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/) collects environmental data, including external weather conditions, store traffic patterns, and HVAC performance, to predict temperature impact and optimize refrigeration system performance across all store locations.

### Analyze and transform

Ingest the data to [Eventstreams](../event-streams/overview.md) where the incoming temperature data undergoes real-time processing. This real-time processing enables immediate data analysis including:
