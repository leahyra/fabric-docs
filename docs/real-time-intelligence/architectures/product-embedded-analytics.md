# Product embedded analytics reference architecture

Product embedded analytics enables manufacturers and service providers to deliver real-time insights directly within their products, giving customers immediate visibility into equipment performance and operational health. This approach transforms products from simple devices into intelligent, connected solutions that continuously deliver value through data-driven insights.

This reference architecture demonstrates how you can use Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to build comprehensive product embedded analytics solutions that handle millions of IoT events daily from customer factory floors with low latency at high scale. You can process streaming device data and integrate full asset metadata and hierarchy from manufacturer libraries to enable customized analytics experiences and real-time insights for each customer.

The architecture supports complex multitenant analytics operations where devices from customer factory floors continuously generate IoT events. These events provide real-time visibility into equipment performance, operational status, and device health. The architecture integrates daily collected asset metadata through Data Factory and maintains comprehensive device hierarchies stored in OneLake for unified customer analytics experiences.

## Architecture overview

The product embedded analytics reference architecture uses Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence to create a unified platform that processes real-time data from customer devices and integrates manufacturer asset metadata for intelligent multitenant analytics management.

The following diagram shows the key components and data flows in this architecture. You can implement the architecture with four main operational phases, each building on the previous to deliver comprehensive embedded analytics capabilities:

- **Ingest & process**: This phase captures millions of IoT events daily from customer factory floors and integrates manufacturer asset metadata.

- **Analyze & transform**: This phase aggregates and enriches streaming events with asset metadata to create curated customer views.

- **Train**: This phase builds advanced ML models with real-time training and scoring capabilities.

- **Visualize & Activate**: This phase provides customized dashboards, real-time notifications, and dedicated customer applications.

## Operational phases

This section describes each operational phase in detail, explaining the data flows, processing steps, and capabilities enabled at each stage of the product embedded analytics pipeline.

### Ingest & process

In this phase, devices from the customer factory floor natively generate and stream millions of IoT events daily to [Eventstream](../event-streams/overview.md), providing low latency at high scale. This continuous data stream captures real-time device performance, operational metrics, and equipment health indicators across multiple customer environments for immediate processing and analysis.

Full asset metadata and hierarchy are collected daily from the manufacturer libraries using [Data Factory](../../data-factory/data-factory-overview.md) and stored in [OneLake](../../onelake/onelake-overview.md). This metadata enables comprehensive device contextualization, including the following types of information:

- Equipment specifications and performance baselines define the expected operating parameters for each device type.

- Asset hierarchies and device relationships map the connections between equipment in customer environments.

- Manufacturer documentation and operational parameters provide reference information for device operation.

- Device configuration and capability information describe the features and settings for each device.

- Customer-specific deployment and usage patterns capture how each customer uses their equipment.

**Real-world scenario example**: An industrial equipment manufacturer processes millions of IoT events daily from customer-deployed machinery across hundreds of factories worldwide. Data Factory collects comprehensive asset metadata from manufacturer libraries including equipment specifications, maintenance procedures, and performance baselines, while Eventstream captures real-time operational data from pumps, compressors, and production equipment providing immediate visibility into customer equipment performance and health status.
