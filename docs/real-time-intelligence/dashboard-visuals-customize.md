# Customize Real-Time Dashboard visuals

Real-Time Dashboards are a collection of tiles that feature a visual representation supported by an underlying Kusto Query Language (KQL) query. This article explains how to edit the visualizations and queries of a Real-Time Dashboard tile. It also provides an overview of customization properties specific to each visualization type.

Real-Time Dashboards support all visualizations that you can create in the context of the [render operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/renderoperator?context=/fabric/context/context-rta&pivots=fabric#visualizations), along with the [dashboard-specific visuals](dashboard-visuals.md).

## Prerequisites

* A [workspace](../fundamentals/create-workspaces.md) with a Microsoft Fabric-enabled [capacity](../enterprise/licenses.md#capacity)
* Editor permissions on a [Real-Time Dashboard](dashboard-real-time-create.md)

## Customize a dashboard tile

To make changes to your dashboard:

1. In the top menu, select **Viewing** and toggle to **Editing** mode.

1. On the tile that you want to customize, select the **Edit** icon. Edit the underlying query or the visualization properties.
1. Select **Apply changes** to save your changes and return to the dashboard.

## Customization properties

The following table describes the available customization properties, categorized alphabetically by section, and specifies which visuals support each property.

## Data series colors

By using data series colors, you control how colors are applied to your visuals. Instead of relying on automatic color assignments, assign specific colors to each data series to convey meaning and maintain consistency across your dashboards.

By using data series colors, you can:

* Assign colors directly to each data series.

* Override system defaults with intentional choices.

* Maintain color consistency across visuals and dashboards.

This feature is supported for the following visual types: Anomaly chart, Area chart, Bar chart, Column chart, Line chart, Pie chart, Scatter chart, and Time chart.

To configure data series colors:

1. In the top menu, select **Viewing** and toggle to **Editing** mode.

1. On the tile you want to customize, select the **Edit** icon.

1. In the **Visual** tab of the formatting pane, expand the **Series colors** section.

1. Select a color for each data series in your visual.

1. Select **Apply changes** to save your settings.

When you assign colors intentionally, viewers can interpret visuals at a glance without needing to read legends or labels. Consider using colors that align with your organization's standards or that naturally convey the meaning of each series, such as red for critical states or green for healthy metrics.

## Embed images

You can embed images in your dashboard tiles by using Markdown text.

For more information on GitHub Flavored Markdown, see [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

1. Open a [Real-Time Dashboard](dashboard-real-time-create.md#create-a-new-dashboard).
1. In the top menu, select **New text tile** to open a text tile.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customize-dashboard-visuals/add-tile.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Home menu in a Real-Time Dashboard. The option titled Add text is highlighted.":::

1. In the query pane, paste the URL of an image located in an image hosting service by using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![](URL)
    ```

    The image renders in the tile's preview.

1. In the top menu, select **Apply changes** to save the tile.
