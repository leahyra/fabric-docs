# Pricing example: Copy data from Azure SQL Database to Fabric Lakehouse using Virtual Network Data Gateway

In this scenario, you copy data from an Azure SQL Database deployed in a private virtual network to a Lakehouse table in Microsoft Fabric by using a Copy job with the Virtual Network (VNET) Data Gateway.

Use this pattern when you secure your data sources by using **Private Endpoints** and need to keep data movement within private network boundaries.

Unlike the On-premises Data Gateway, the **VNET Data Gateway consumes Fabric capacity based on uptime**, in addition to the capacity consumed by Data Factory workloads such as Copy jobs. The effective gateway uptime is the **Copy job execution time plus the configured Time to Live (TTL)** after job completion.

>[!NOTE]
>The prices used in the following example are hypothetical and don’t intend to imply exact actual pricing. The estimates demonstrate how you can estimate, plan, and manage cost for Data Factory projects in Microsoft Fabric.
>
>Since Fabric capacities are priced uniquely across regions, refer to [the Microsoft Fabric pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/) to explore Fabric capacity pricing regionally.

## Configuration

To set up this scenario, you need the following resources and configuration settings:

- Azure SQL Database with **Private Endpoint** in a customer-managed VNET.
- **VNET Data Gateway** deployed in the same VNET with:
   - **Number of gateway members (nodes): 2**
- A Copy job configured with:
   - **Source**: Azure SQL Database via VNET Data Gateway
   - **Sink**: Fabric Lakehouse table
   - **Copy mode**: Full copy for the first run, followed by incremental loads.
- **Gateway Time to Live (TTL): 30 minutes** after job completion.

## Cost components

This scenario includes two cost components:

1. **VNET Data Gateway uptime cost** (based on job duration and TTL)
1. **Copy job execution cost** (Data Movement meters)

You bill both costs to the Fabric or Power BI Premium capacity.

## VNET Data Gateway uptime cost

- CU consumption rate per gateway member: **4 CUs**
- Number of gateway members: **2**
- Gateway uptime per run: **Copy job duration plus TTL**

Capacity consumption formula:

CU seconds = 4 × (number of gateway members) × (uptime in seconds)

### Full copy run - gateway uptime

Assumptions:

- Copy job duration: **8 minutes**
- TTL after job: **30 minutes**

Gateway uptime calculation:

8 minutes + 30 minutes = 38 minutes = 2,280 seconds

CU seconds consumed by gateway calculation:

4 × 2 × 2,280 = 18,240 CU seconds

Convert to CU hours calculation:

18,240 / 3,600 ≈ 5.07 CU hours

Gateway cost for full copy run:

5.07 × $0.18 ≈ $0.91

### Incremental copy run - gateway uptime

Assumptions:

- Copy job duration: **1 minute**
- TTL after job: **30 minutes**

Gateway uptime calculation:

1 min + 30 min = 31 minutes = 1,860 seconds

CU seconds consumed by gateway calculation:

4 × 2 × 1,860 = 14,880 CU seconds

Convert to CU hours calculation:

14,880 / 3,600 ≈ 4.13 CU hours

Gateway cost per incremental run calculation:

4.13 × $0.18 ≈ $0.74

## Copy job execution cost

Copy job pricing is independent of gateway uptime and uses Data Factory pricing meters.

### Full copy (initial load)

Assumptions:

- Data size: **500 GB**
- Intelligent throughput optimization: **128**
- Duration: **8 minutes**

Used CU hours:

128 × 1.5 × (8 / 60) = 25.6 CU hours

CU seconds:

25.6 × 3600 = 92,160 CU seconds

Copy job cost:

25.6 × $0.18 = $4.61

### Incremental copy (daily load)

Assumptions:

- New data: **5 GB**
- Intelligent throughput optimization: **4**
- Duration: **1 minute**

Used CU hours:

4 × 3 × (1 / 60) = 0.2 CU hours

CU seconds:

0.2 × 3600 = 720 CU seconds

Copy job cost per run:

0.2 × $0.18 = $0.036

## Total cost estimate

**First run (full copy)**

| **Component**              | **Cost**    |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| VNET Gateway uptime        | $0.91      |
| Copy job execution         | $4.61      |
| **Total (full copy run)**  | **$5.52**  |

**Ongoing incremental run**

| **Component**                  | **Cost**    |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| VNET Gateway uptime            | $0.74      |
| Copy job execution             | $0.04      |
| **Total per incremental run**  | **$0.78**  |

## Key takeaways

- VNET Data Gateway cost comes from **job duration + TTL**, not from 24/7 uptime when you configure TTL.
- Increasing the number of gateway members improves availability but **linearly increases gateway cost**.
- Data movement cost and gateway uptime cost are **separate and additive**.

## Comparison with on-premises data gateway

- **VNET Data Gateway**
   - Charged by Fabric capacity based on uptime (4 CUs per node)
   - No customer-managed VMs required
- **On-premises Data Gateway (OPDG)**
   - No Fabric capacity charge for the gateway
   - Customers must run and pay for **VMs or servers 24/7**, including HA clusters

In both cases, you pay separately for Data Factory workload execution by using standard Fabric pricing meters.
